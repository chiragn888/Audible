Based on the plan for modification, I will refactor the `audible.py` file to function as a module. Here is the updated code:

```python
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract
import cv2
import pyttsx3
import os

# Initialize the text-to-speech engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)

def talk(text, filename):
    # Save the spoken text to an audio file
    engine.save_to_file(text, filename)
    engine.runAndWait()

def convert_pdf_to_audio(pdf_path):
    poppler_path = r'path'  # Update this path to where poppler is installed
    images = convert_from_path(pdf_path=pdf_path, poppler_path=poppler_path)
    sent = ""

    for count, img in enumerate(images):
        img_name = f"page_{count+1}.png"
        img.save(img_name, "PNG")

        img = cv2.imread(img_name)
        text = pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open(img_name), lang='eng')
        sent += text
        os.remove(img_name)  # Clean up image files

    audio_filename = 'audible.mp3'
    talk(sent, audio_filename)
    return audio_filename
```

This refactored code removes the input statement and print statements, encapsulates the conversion logic into the `convert_pdf_to_audio` function, and adjusts the `talk` function to save the audio output to a file. The function now returns the path to the generated audio file, which can be used by the web server to send the file to the user. Additionally, the code cleans up the generated image files after processing.
