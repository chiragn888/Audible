To address the plan of action, I will refactor the existing code into a FastAPI application and modify the audio conversion logic to be callable from an endpoint. Here is the complete code for `src/main.py`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File, HTTPException, Depends, Response
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract
import cv2
import pyttsx3
import io
import tempfile

# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# OAuth2PasswordBearer is a class that provides a way to get the token from the request
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

# Initialize text-to-speech engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)

# Authentication endpoint (dummy implementation for demonstration purposes)
@app.post("/token")
async def token(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):
    return {"access_token": form_data.username, "token_type": "bearer"}

# Root endpoint to confirm the server is running
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Server is running"}

# Function to convert PDF to audio
def pdf_to_audio(pdf_file: UploadFile):
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
        # Convert PDF to images
        images = convert_from_path(pdf_path=pdf_file.file, poppler_path=r'path', output_folder=temp_dir)
        full_text = ""

        # Extract text from images
        for img in images:
            text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img, lang='eng')
            full_text += text

        # Convert text to speech and save as an audio file
        audio_file_path = f"{temp_dir}/audible.mp3"
        engine.save_to_file(full_text, audio_file_path)
        engine.runAndWait()

        # Read the audio file and return the byte stream
        with open(audio_file_path, 'rb') as audio_file:
            audio_bytes = audio_file.read()
        return audio_bytes

# Endpoint for uploading a PDF and getting audio conversion
@app.post("/upload_pdf/")
async def upload_pdf(pdf: UploadFile = File(...), token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    if pdf.content_type != 'application/pdf':
        raise HTTPException(status_code=415, detail="Unsupported file type. Please upload a PDF file.")
    
    audio_bytes = pdf_to_audio(pdf)
    return Response(content=audio_bytes, media_type="audio/mpeg")

# Dummy implementation of the audio conversion logic from `audible.py`
# This should be replaced with the actual logic from `audible.py`
def talk(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()
```

This code sets up a FastAPI application with the required endpoints and refactors the audio conversion logic into a callable function that accepts an `UploadFile` object. The interactive elements have been removed, and the function returns the audio file as a byte stream that can be sent as a response by the FastAPI endpoint. The `pdf_to_audio` function uses a temporary directory to store the intermediate images and the final audio file, ensuring that no files are left behind after the request is processed.
