# PDF to Audio Converter

Convert Ebooks ðŸ“š or pdf's to audio ðŸ”‰ files and listen to them hassle-free. This project utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies to transform PDF documents into audible formats. It's an ideal solution for those who prefer listening over reading, making learning and entertainment more accessible and enjoyable.

## Installation

To use this PDF to Audio Converter, you need to install several libraries. You can install them using the following pip commands:

```bash
pip install pytesseract
pip install pdf2image
pip install Pillow
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
pip install pyttsx3
```

Make sure you have the poppler utility installed on your system, as it is required by the pdf2image library for PDF processing.

## Usage

To convert your PDF files to audio, follow these steps:

1. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python audible.py
   ```
2. When prompted, enter the filename of the PDF you wish to convert.

Please ensure that you set the correct path for the poppler utility in your system's environment variables, as it is necessary for the pdf2image library to function properly.
