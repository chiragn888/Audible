Based on the plan for modification, here is the refactored code for `audible.py`:

```python
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract
import cv2
import pyttsx3
import os

# Initialize the text-to-speech engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)

def convert_pdf_to_audio(pdf_path, output_folder='audio_output'):
    """
    Convert a PDF file to an audio file.

    :param pdf_path: The file path to the PDF to be converted.
    :param output_folder: The folder where the audio file will be saved.
    :return: The file path to the generated audio file.
    """
    poppler_path = r'path_to_poppler'  # Update this to your poppler installation path
    images = convert_from_path(pdf_path=pdf_path, poppler_path=poppler_path)
    full_text = ""

    # Convert each page to text
    for count, img in enumerate(images):
        img_name = f"page_{count+1}.png"
        img.save(img_name, "PNG")
        img_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open(img_name), lang='eng')
        full_text += img_text
        os.remove(img_name)  # Clean up image files

    # Save the text to a temporary file
    temp_text_file = 'temp_text.txt'
    with open(temp_text_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(full_text)

    # Generate the audio file
    audio_file_path = os.path.join(output_folder, 'audible.mp3')
    engine.save_to_file(full_text, audio_file_path)
    engine.runAndWait()

    # Clean up the temporary text file
    os.remove(temp_text_file)

    return audio_file_path

# Example usage (comment out or remove before integrating with Flask):
# audio_path = convert_pdf_to_audio('example.pdf')
# print(f"Generated audio file: {audio_path}")
```

This refactored code defines a callable function `convert_pdf_to_audio` that accepts a PDF file path and an optional output folder. It converts the PDF to an audio file and returns the path to the generated audio file. The function also cleans up any temporary files created during the process.

Remember to replace `'path_to_poppler'` with the actual path to your Poppler installation, and ensure that the `output_folder` exists or is created before calling the function. The example usage at the bottom is for testing purposes and should be commented out or removed when integrating with the Flask application.
