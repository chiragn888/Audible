To address the plan for modification of the code, I will refactor the script to accept an uploaded file as a parameter, modify the `talk` function to return the MP3 file content, and ensure the script can be called as a function from `main.py`. Here is the modified code:

```python
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract
import cv2
from googletrans import Translator
import os
from io import BytesIO
import pyttsx3

# Initialize the text-to-speech engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)

def talk(text):
    # Generate speech from text
    engine.say(text)
    mp3_fp = BytesIO()
    engine.save_to_file(text, mp3_fp)
    engine.runAndWait()
    mp3_fp.seek(0)
    return mp3_fp

def convert_pdf_to_speech(pdf_file_stream, poppler_path):
    images = convert_from_path(pdf_file=pdf_file_stream, poppler_path=poppler_path)
    sent = ""
    
    for count, img in enumerate(images):
        img_name = f"page_{count+1}.png"
        img.save(img_name, "PNG")
        
        img = cv2.imread(img_name)
        text = pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open(img_name), lang='eng')
        sent += text
        os.remove(img_name)  # Clean up the image file after processing
    
    mp3_content = talk(sent)
    return mp3_content

# This function can be called from main.py
def process_pdf_and_get_mp3(pdf_file_stream, poppler_path=r'path_to_poppler'):
    return convert_pdf_to_speech(pdf_file_stream, poppler_path)
```

This refactored code now includes a `convert_pdf_to_speech` function that takes a PDF file stream and the path to the poppler binaries as parameters. The `talk` function has been updated to use an in-memory file (`BytesIO`) to store the generated MP3 content, which it returns after speaking. The `process_pdf_and_get_mp3` function is designed to be called from `main.py`, and it returns the MP3 file stream that can be sent in a response. The temporary PNG files created during the conversion process are cleaned up after their content has been processed.
