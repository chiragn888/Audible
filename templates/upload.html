Sure, here's the implementation for the HTML file upload form template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>PDF File Upload</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Upload PDF File</h1>
    <form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" name="pdfFile" accept=".pdf" required>
        <input type="submit" value="Upload">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

This HTML form allows authenticated users to submit PDF files for conversion by selecting the file and clicking the "Upload" button. The form is submitted to the "/upload" route using the POST method with the enctype set to "multipart/form-data" to handle file uploads. The accept attribute restricts the file selection to only PDF files.
