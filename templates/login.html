Based on the plan for modification provided, I will replace the current content with a basic HTML structure for a login form. The code below will be the new content for the `login.html` template, which should be located in the `templates` directory of your Flask application. This new HTML structure will include a form with 'username' and 'password' input fields and a submit button, with the 'action' attribute set to the URL for the login route and the 'method' attribute set to "POST".

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Login</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form action="/login" method="POST">
        <div>
            <label for="username">Username:</label>
            <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
        </div>
        <div>
            <label for="password">Password:</label>
            <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
        </div>
        <div>
            <button type="submit">Login</button>
        </div>
        {% if error %}
            <p>{{ error }}</p>
        {% endif %}
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

Please ensure that this HTML content replaces the existing content in the `login.html` file within the `templates` directory of your Flask application. The Flask route for `/login` will render this template when a GET request is made, and the form will be submitted to the same route with a POST request, as per the current code structure and the plan for modification.
